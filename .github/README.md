Hiya, and welcome to a conversion of a Skid Row crack intro!
I have changed one thing about this intro.
And it is that the lines all automatically center justify but read on.
If you want all the ltters to line up like the original then you can just pad the strings out with blank spaces and it will have that effect.
Anyway it has been a fast and simple conversion so I hope it is ok. - Widow Maker E.D
